                <p>The design studio team at Paystack produced all the graphic assets that were used by various teams across the company. These graphic assets included social media posts for events, product launch announcements, certificates, zoom backgrounds, etc. The requests for these assets were very frequent, and they caused 2 major problems;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repetitive tasks: Most of the design requests required minor adjustments on predefined layouts, consuming significant time that could be spent on more challenging tasks.</li>
                    <li>Long turn around times: Some design requests required multiple conversations between the design studio team and the requesters, leading to long turn around times on those requests.</li>

                    <p>The design studio team shared a detailed brief sharing the issues they had been experiencing, and what they envisioned Panda to be. Based on the brief they shared, we created a list of assumption statements. We were assuming that;</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Our target users were the design studio team, and Stacks (non-designers in other teams within Paystack)</li>
                        <li>The Stacks wanted faster turn-around time for their design requests.</li>
                        <li>The design studio team wanted to spend less time working on repetitive tasks.</li>
                        <li>The design studio team wanted to make sure that every design sent off was good enough and consistent with the Paystack brand.</li>
                        <li>Users needed multiple sizes of posters for different touchpoints (banners, social media, billboards, etc)</li>

                    <p>Our next step was to speak with our identified target users to validate our assumptions, as well as fill in any knowledge gaps that we had. The goals of our research were:</p>

                    <p class="section-text">BRAINSTORMING</p>
                </div>
                <p>Our initial idea was to create two separate portals for Panda;
                    <ol>
                      <li>A portal for Stacks</li>
                      <li>Another portal for the Design studio team</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, during our brainstorming session, we started thinking deeply about how these would work. There were 2 things to consider:
                </p>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>The first one was;</p>
                    <div class="block2">
                        <p>"How can we make sure that all the assets produced by Stacks look consistent (in terms of spacing and layout), and match the Paystack brand?”</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>We figured out a solution for this. Instead of letting the Stacks directly edit the template, we thought about showing them a preview of the template, and providing them with a form that they could fill to edit that template. The form provided would depend on the template they wanted to edit, and the text fields would have character limits to ensure that any content added to the template did not mess up the layout.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>The second one was;</p>
                    <div class="block2">
                        <p>How exactly will the portal for the design studio team function?”</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>While thinking through the answer to this question, we discovered some potential problems with designing a separate portal for the design studio. We already knew that the design studio team made use of advanced applications like Figma in their day-to-day work, so the questions were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Is it a smart idea to ask them to use a tool with much limited functionality to perform tasks that can be performed better on another application?</li>
                        <li>Can we build something that would replicate some of Figma’s essential features, and even if we can, is it a wise idea to try given that we have just 3 weeks?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The answer to both questions was “No”, so we decided to discard the portal for the design studio team. We decided that the templates could already be uploaded by the engineers, and the Stacks could then make use of those templates to generate their assets.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">

                    <p>The first step in the design process was to define the user flow for desktop and mobile.</p>

                    <p>We also worked on the low fidelity wireframes to determine what the basic structure would be. We decided to have a single page design with 3 distinct sections.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first section is the Build section with the form for Stacks to fill. These forms are dynamic, and are generated based on the asset the Stack wants to generate.</li>
                        <li>The second section is the Preview section. After Stacks have filled a form, they can click on a button and see a preview of their flyer in the top right section.</li>
                        <li>In the last section, Stacks can see what their flyer would look like across different touch points. (The touch points also differ based on the assets)</li>
